   <h1>About Me</h1>
   <p>My name is Darian Maqsood, and I'm a computer programming hobbyist. Some things I like to do in my free time are reading books or comic books,(huge fan of DC/Marvel Comics) playing video games, programming, watching Netflix or just stuff in general. I've been interested in software and programming ever since I was litle and am aiming to get a job as a software enginner.
   Or, if I change my mind, I would want to become a CEH(Certified Ethical Hacker) because I like to look for vulnerablities in software and patch them, it just sounds fun to be a whie hat hacker, but I'd rather write more code, so I see what I'll do in the future.</p>
